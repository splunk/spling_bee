  			<h2>Welcome to the SPLing Bee App!</h2>
        <p>Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback at sluedtke@splunk.com.  Enjoy! </p>
        <p><strong>For Moderators:</strong></p>
  			<ul>
  				 <li>
                   <strong>Setup Notes:</strong> Install SPLBee App on an instance accessible over internet or local network where contestants will reside.  The app includes the spl_bee index and a TCP input listening on 8999 for contestant submissions. You will also need to install <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1724/">Lookup Editor</a> to edit questions/answers and keep score.
              </li><br/>
                <li>
                    I find it best to open each page on a separate tab: "SPLing Bee", "Edit Results", "Scoreboard", and "Edit Questions".
                </li>
  				<li>
            		The "SPLing Bee" Page will be used to deliver the questions and content. 
                </li>
  				<li>
            		Add your questions and answers to the "Edit Questions" Page/Lookup.  Please make sure you have tested your questions and answers for functionality and correctness before you begin the competition.
              	</li>
  				<li>
            		At the end of each round/question, *** IMPORTANT *** copy the results table into the "Edit Results" Lookup.  Append each round's results to the existing results. This will keep track of the scores from each round.
              	</li>
              	<li>
            		Refresh Scoreboard to show overall results.
              </li>
             
            </ul>
        <p><strong>For Contestants:</strong></p>
  			<ul>
  				<li>
                  You will need a Splunk instance connected to the internet or local network where the master instance resides.  This could be your own OR a Splunk Cloud Trial - https://www.splunk.com/page/sign_up/cloudtrial.
                </li>
  				<li>
                  You will need to download and install the <a href="https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3288/">Add-on for SPLing Bee</a> App from Splunkbase and restart.
                </li>
  				<li>
            		  Go to Settings --> Advanced Search --> Search Macros and edit the `sendresults` macro. Replace &lt;yournamehere&gt; with a unique name and &lt;ip&gt; with the IP Address of the Judging Instance.
              	</li>
  				<li>
            		Points are awarded for correct answers as well as time of submission (earliest=most points)
              	</li>
                <li>
                  Make sure your result is renamed as "answer", use the macro `sendresults` to submit your answers!
              	</li>
